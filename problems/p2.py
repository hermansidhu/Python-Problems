# ARS Gems Store sells different varieties of gems to its customers. Write a Python
# program to calculate the bill amount to be paid by a customer based on the list of
# gemsÂ and quantity purchased. Any purchase with a total bill amount above Rs.30000
# is entitled for 5% discount. If any gem required by the customer is not available in the
# store, then consider total bill amount to be -1. Assume that quantity required by the
# customer for any gem will always be greater than 0. Perform case-sensitive
# comparison wherever applicable.
